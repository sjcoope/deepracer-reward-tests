# deepracer-reward-tests

A repository of some sample reward functions and results from testing models.

## Naming Convention

[MODEL-NAME]-[REVISION]

- Each time you retrain the same model without changing it you increment the revision.
- If you tweak anything on the model (reward function, hyper parameters, etc.) add another revision

e.g.

- ModelName-001 = First revision of a new model
- ModelName-002 = Retrain of previous model
- ModelName-002-001 = Tweaked model and created another revision.
